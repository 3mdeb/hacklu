finding offset into buffer

de bruijn pattern (cyclic pattern, can find offset)
made popular by metasploit/peda

r2 has this feature

bof - pwnablekr
set dword to magic value

ragg2 -P <number> -r # generate pattern.
debug profile can set args/stdin/etc, so we can set inputs

r2 -de dbg.profile=bof.rr2 bof
dcu sym.func
db (check address)
	0xf779b654 b  817d08bebafe.  cmp dword [ebp + 8], 0xcafebabe ; [0xcafebabe:4]=-1 
dc

drr = show registers with context. notice ebp points somewhere in our string,
find the offset of this

pxr 4 @ ebp + 8 # print hex with references

[0xf779b62c]> pxr 4 @ ebp + 8     
0xffebbd10  0x41534141  AASA ascii

now we know where this is pointing, simple to get the offset!
[0xf779b62c]> woO 0x41534141
52                          

so ebp + 8 points 52 bytes into the buffer.
